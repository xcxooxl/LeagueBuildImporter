# LeagueBuildImporter

**No more locking champions without time to get the right build**



Imports builds(runes + items) from mobafire to league of legends automatically when locking a champion.
Also supports searching by role if in draft pick/ranked


**Will NOT work if you have full rune pages, This application does NOT delete exisiting rune pages, Only adds new ones.**

Credits to Wazzaps for coming up with the algorithm to connect to league api.

**This does not give you any in-game advantage, Just makes life simpler when deciding in champ select**
